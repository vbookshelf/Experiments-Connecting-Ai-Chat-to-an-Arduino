# Experiments Connecting an LLM to an Arduino
My experiments using function calling to connect a Large Language Model (LLM) to an Arduino

## Learning Goals
- Send instructions from a chat interface to the Arduino e.g. User: Please switch on the light.
- Get the LLM to retrieve temperature and humidity sensor readings from the Arduino e.g. User: What's the temperature?
