# Experiments Connecting Ai chat to an Arduino
My experiments using function calling to connect a Large Language Model (LLM) to an Arduino

## Learning Goals
- Send instructions from a chat interface to the Arduino e.g. User: Please switch on the light.
- Get the LLM to retrieve temperature and humidity sensor readings from the Arduino e.g. User: What's the temperature?

## Lessons learned
- Buy the correct OLED. Some OLEDS have a dual color screen. The top 16 pixel rows always display yellow and the rest of the rows display blue. These colors can't be adjusted. Unless you want these dual colors be sure to buy the monochrome display where all pixels display the same colour.
